# ArUco Marker-Based Video Augmentation

This project implements video augmentation using ArUco markers. The program detects predefined ArUco markers in a recorded video and replaces a selected region with another video using homography transformation.

# Features
- Detects ArUco markers in the input video.
- Computes homography transformation to overlay a new video on the detected region.
- Handles frame-by-frame augmentation for seamless replacement.
- Supports custom scaling factors for precise alignment.
- Ensures smooth processing with FPS validation and error handling.
