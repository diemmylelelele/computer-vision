# Computer Vision

This repository features a curated collection of Computer Vision algorithms and techniques implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring and applying cutting-edge image processing
### Implemented Techniques
1. ArUco Marker Detection (```aruco_marker/```)
 - Detects ArUco markers in images or videos.
 - Computes homography transformation for marker-based augmentation.
 - Applications: Augmented reality (AR), camera calibration.
2. Hough Transform (```hough_transform/```)
 - Implements Hough Transform to detect lines and circles.
 - Used for edge detection and shape recognition.
 - Applications: Traffic sign detection, medical imaging.
3. Pupil Eye Detection (```pupil_eye_detection/```)
 - Detects pupil position in human eyes.
 - Uses image thresholding and contour detection.
 - Applications: Eye-tracking, medical diagnostics, human-computer interaction.
